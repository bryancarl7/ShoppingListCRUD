# ShoppingListCRUD #
A small applet to mimic a shopping list's functionality in a single webpage

*** A little Background: ***
I've never really done a React -> Express -> Postgres stack *from scratch*
<br> before, so I thought it'd be fun at the very least to learn something 
<br> new through this process. I've used all three of these extensively in a <br> professional environments, but at my current workplace, we rarely get to <br> write code from scratch. So bear with me.

## Requirements ##
- NodeJS v14.18.0
- npm 6.14.15

## Usage ##
1. `git clone https://github.com/bryancarl7/ShoppingListCRUD.git`
2. `cd ShoppingListCRUD`
3. `npm install`
4. `cd client && npm install`
4. `cd .. && npm run dev`

And that's it! Open up your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and you should hopefully see the text displayed. 

If you're reading this, you're a little too early, will update soon <br>
with the proper backend support and frontend look.<br>
